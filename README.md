# Plant-Care-System
Collaborated on the design and development of Smart Pot, a plant care system using LABVIEW and NI-DAQmx.  The system featured custom-built soil moisture sensors, AMT1001 temperature and humidity sensors, LDR sensors for light intensity detection, and actuators (humidifier, grow light, stepper motors, and water pump) for environmental control.
